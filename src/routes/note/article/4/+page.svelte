            <h2 class="text-xl">1. Introduction to the King-Byng Affair</h2>

            <p class="text-base">The King-Byng Affair was a political crisis that took place in Canada in the mid-1920s, involving a
                conflict between the country's Prime Minister Mackenzie King and Governor General Byng. The affair
                marked a significant turning point in Canadian history and has been widely studied and debated by
                scholars and political historians</p>
            <p class="text-base">At its core, the King-Byng Affair was a struggle for power between the Prime Minister and the Governor
                General, with each seeking to assert their respective roles and responsibilities in the country's
                government. The events of the affair would have lasting impacts on the relationship between the Prime
                Minister and the Governor General, as well as on the development of Canadian democracy and government as
                a whole.</p>


            <h2 class="text-2xl">2.Historical context leading up to the affair</h2>

            <p>In the early 20th century, Canada was a Dominion within the British Empire, with its own government but
                still subordinate to the British Crown. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was intent on
                asserting Canadian independence and furthering the country's autonomy. At the same time, tensions were
                growing between King and Governor General Julian Byng, who represented the British Crown in Canada.
                These tensions would come to a head in the King-Byng Affair of 1926.</p>
            <p>The period leading up to the affair was marked by political instability in Canada, with frequent changes
                in government and a contentious relationship between the Prime Minister and the Governor General. King's
                government was minority, relying on support from other parties to pass legislation. This situation,
                combined with the personal animosity between the two leaders, set the stage for the constitutional
                crisis that would become the King-Byng Affair.</p>
